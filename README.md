# C++ Concepts & Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This is a curated collection of concepts, examples, and notes I've compiled while learning C++ to strengthen my programming skills. This repository is beginner-friendly and designed to help others explore C++ concepts and the **Standard Template Library (STL)** in a structured manner.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **Basics**  
   It covers the foundational concepts such as data types, operators, control structures, and functions.  

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   Dive into classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

3. **Advanced Concepts**  
   Topics like pointers, memory management, file handling, templates, and friend functions.  

4. **Data Structures**  
   Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

5. **Standard Template Library (STL)**  
   Comprehensive examples and use cases of STL components like:  
   - Containers: `vector`, `map`, `set`, `deque`, etc.  
   - Iterators and Algorithms: `sort`, `binary_search`, etc.  
   - Utilities: `pair`, etc.  

6. **Problem-Solving**  
   Real-world problems and their solutions using C++ and STL.
